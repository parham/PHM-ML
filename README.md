#### PHM-ML

@Project: PHM-ML
@Year: 2013
@Organization: University of Malaya

The project has been initiated in 2013, So I decided to clean it up and put it out there in case other developers and researchers like the proposed objectives in this project :D

## Objectives
1. Prepare a platform for researchers to implement their algorithms more easily
2. By adding most recent published methods in the library, researchers can easily use the codes for any benchmarking or comparison.
and many more ...

## Reference:
In case of using this library , please cite one or more of the following papers:
